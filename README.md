# EEGaqui_fpga_headstage
32 lead aquisition with ice40 fpga's and headstage w/ peripherals (3 axis accellerometer, gyro), targeting for low power consumption (between 1-2V, minus usb), ideally running off of rechargable batteries

Inspired by OpenEphys setup, but wanna try to optimize for low cost, low power, efficent heat dissipation with good signal quality. I might want to add ~10-20us beamforming emmeded in the hardware, but we'll see.
